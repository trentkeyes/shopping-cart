# Shopping Cart

---

[Live app](https://trentkeyes.github.io/shopping-cart/)

Inpsired by the [the Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart). Created with React.

Simple shop app where users can add items to a shopping cart and see a price total. This shop features the highest-selling records from the year I was born, 1989. Unfortunately, there is no way to buy these records on the app because it's not a real store.

### Features

- Navigate between home page and store.
- Add items to cart and see a running total of items added.
- Click on the shopping cart in the nav bar to see a breakdown of items and the total price.

### Features to add

- Checkout page

### I learned about

- Testing with React Testing Library and Jest.
- Using React Router to navigate between pages (with shared nav bar).
- Adding a modal using react-modal
